# pika's mealplan server

Running at <https://mealplan.pikans.org/>

## Most important files

* `data.go`: loads and saves all the state from/to disk
* `server/signup.go`: has all the logic for displaying the pages & handling user input
* `server/signup.html`: a [Go HTML template](https://golang.org/pkg/text/template/) which is used to display the main page (for both authorized and unauthorized users)

## How to deploy

Before you deploy, you'll need to clone pika's cdist repo: <https://wiki.pikans.org/yfncc/git#yfncc-cdist>.

You'll also need SSH keys for root on `pika-web.mit.edu` -- ask yfncc.

1. Make sure you're in the `server` directory
2. Build for OpenBSD: `env GOOS=openbsd GOARCH=amd64 go build`
3. Copy the resulting `server` binary to the cdist repo, at `cdist/conf/manifest/bin/openbsd/mealplan`, and copy `server.html` and `admin.html` (if changed) into `cdist/conf/manifest/html/`
4. Navigate up to `yfncc-cdist/` in the cdist repo and run `./bin/cdist config -v pika-web.mit.edu`
5. (If the binary changed) SSH into `pika-web.mit.edu` and restart the server:
  1. `su mealplan` to change into user `mealplan`
  2. `tmux attach` to attach to an existing `tmux` session, or just `tmux` to start a new one
  3. Kill the existing `mealplanserver` process, either with Ctrl+C if it's in the console, or finding the process and stopping it.
  4. Start it anew, with `./run.sh` or `./run-console.sh`, depending on whether you want to get live console output in the `tmux` session (*only* do this if you're running in `tmux`, or else it will die once your SSH connection dies!)
  
### NOTE: make sure when changing anything in this repo to commit,
    push, and execute `go get github.com/pikans/mealplan`; otherwise,
    parts of this development that refer to other files in the repo by
    use of a go remote import from the github repo will not use the
    updated bits!
